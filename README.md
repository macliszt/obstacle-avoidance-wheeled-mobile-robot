Obstacle Avoidance Robot (Arduino)

 ## Obstacle Avoidance Robot (Arduino)

An Arduino-based wheeled mobile robot with obstacle avoidance capabilities. It utilizes one ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor for obstacle detection and navigation.

**Features:**
- Autonomous obstacle avoidance
- Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement
- Servo motor for sensor orientation
- Customizable Arduino code

**Getting Started:**
1. Assemble the robot and connect the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to the Arduino.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code from the "src" folder.
3. Power up the robot to watch it autonomously avoid obstacles.

**Customization:**
Modify the Arduino code to tailor the robot's behavior to your specific project needs. Adjust parameters, obstacle detection ranges, and motion patterns as desired.
